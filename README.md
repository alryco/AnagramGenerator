# Ideas
- the little plastic letters on sydney's board are all caps...so M and W can be used interchangably. Implement this somehow to be able to use certain letters interchangebly, maybe there are others like this (C and U, or H and I maybe? kind of a stretch. But like what if using one U as a C suddenly allows you to spell something super hilarious or something...)

- favoring certain words that lead to funnier sentences (booby, butthole, etc.)

- I think our word list is too broad, getting a better one with only practical words that you'd actually use would make this whole thing work a lot better probably
